This is an example of a testing stack for a node.js api. The stack I've put together here includes Mocha, Chai, and SuperTest. Use these tests for reference when you are setting this stack up in your node project.

This tutorial assumes you already have node.js installed.

Install Mocha with npm
npm install -g mocha

This will install Mocha globally.

Install Chai with npm
npm install chai

Install SuperTest with npm
npm install supertest

Install Express with npm
npm install express

Install Body-Parser with npm
npm install body-parser

Make sure you are in your projectâ€™s parent directory. Then, run the command mocha.

run below command to get json reporter
mocha --reporter json
